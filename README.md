🚗 AgentFleet-AI
Productive Maintenance & Autonomous Service Scheduling Systems For Automotive OEMs ---

🧠 Overview
AgentFleet AI is a complete Predictive Maintenance and Autonomous Service Scheduling System built for automotive OEMs operating in the Industry 4.0 ecosystem.
It leverages telematics data, digital twins, and agentic AI to eliminate unplanned downtime, optimize service operations, and create a continuous improvement feedback loop between field data and manufacturing design.

⚙️ Problem Statement
Automotive OEMs today face major inefficiencies due to:

🚨 Reactive maintenance strategies leading to high repair costs and customer dissatisfaction.
📅 Manual service scheduling causing unbalanced workshop loads and missed slots.
🔄 Lost design insights — field failures rarely reach the R&D and design teams.
🚀 Our Solution
AgentFleet AI transforms raw vehicle telemetry into actionable intelligence through a fully autonomous, data-driven pipeline:

🧩 Predictive Analytics Engine
Detects early signs of component wear, vibration anomalies, and failure trends in real time using:
